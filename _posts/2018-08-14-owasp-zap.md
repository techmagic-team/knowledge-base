## General information

There are lot of different tools for automatic vulnerabilities detection process. Among others I want to highlight OWASP ZAP (Zed
Attack Proxy) tool. 

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the worldâ€™s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds
of international volunteers*. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you
are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

ZAP is easy to understand and use. There are some options that are highly important for understanding before you start using it.

## Modes

ZAP has a 'mode' which can be:

* Safe - no potentially dangerous operations permitted
* Protected - you can only perform (potentially) dangerous actions on URLs in the Scope
* Standard - as in previous releases, you can do anything
* ATTACK - new nodes that are in Scope are actively scanned as soon as they are discovered

It is recommended that you use the Protected mode to ensure that you only attack sites that you mean to.
The mode can be changed via the toolbar (or the ZAP API) and is persisted between sessions.

Full information about modes listed [here](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsModes).

## Spider

The spider is a tool that is used to automatically discover new resources (URLs) on a particular Site. It begins with a list
of URLs to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is started. The Spider then visits these URLs, it identifies
all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit and the process continues recursively as long as new
resources are found. The Spider can configured and started using the Spider dialogue.

More detailed info about spider options and examples of usage listed [here](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsSpider).

## Active Scan

Active scanning attempts to find potential vulnerabilities by using known attacks against the selected targets.
Active scanning is an attack on those targets. You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not own.
It should be noted that active scanning can only find certain types of vulnerabilities. Logical vulnerabilities,
such as broken access control, will not be found by any active or automated vulnerability scanning. Manual penetration
testing should always be performed in addition to active scanning to find all types of vulnerabilities.

More detailed info about active scan listed [here](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsAscan).

## Scan policy

A scan policy defines exactly which rules are run as part of an active scan. It also defines how these rules run influencing
how many requests are made and how likely potential issues are to be flagged. You can define as many scan policies as you like
and select the most appropriate one when you start the scan via the Active Scan Dialog. You can define the default scan policy
to be used for active scans and for the Attack mode via the Options Active Scan screen.
