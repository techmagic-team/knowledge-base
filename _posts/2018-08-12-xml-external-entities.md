## General information

XML External Entity (XXE) refers to a specific type of Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, whereby an attacker is able
to cause Denial of Service (DoS) and access local or remote files and services, by abusing a widely available, rarely used feature
in XML parsers. XML is a vastly used data format found in everything from web services (XML-RPC, SOAP, REST…) to documents
(XML, HTML, DOCX) and image files (SVG, EXIF data…) use XML.

## Preventing

* Disable Parsing of Inline DTDs.
* Limit the Permissions of Your Web Server Process.
* Care about file processing in your application.

## Basic examples

Example of vulnerable *.xml document that can be used for attack.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY>
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
<creds>
    <user>&xxe;</user>
    <pass>mypass</pass>
</creds>
```
