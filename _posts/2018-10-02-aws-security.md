## General information

In this article we're going to talk about security of AWS services that can be used on project. This is very important in nowadays
world because more and more companies use cloud services in their projects. It's also desired target for the "bad guyz"
because they can do a lot of bad things with broken AWS accounts (e.g. cryptocurrency mining, sensitive data dumps, etc.).
With implementation of GDPR this problem became more critical due to big financial fines for personal data disclosure.

## Few words about AWS data leakages

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a widely-used cloud computing provider for organizations of all sizes, offering convenient,
scalable hosting for development, databases and more. Amazon S3 buckets aren't the only data repositories that can leak
data because of the organization's configuration errors. Other cloud services on the AWS platform are often found accessible 
by anyone on the Internet.

Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides highly-available block-level storage volumes that are used with EC2 instances. EBS snapshots
are point-in-time backups of EC2s, used for disaster recovery solutions. For example, in the event of a ransomware attack, you
might need to quickly access a backup of your organization's data for business continuity purposes.

These snapshots are typically moved or need to be accessed elsewhere, which is where the problem lies, as AWS Security Consultant
Scott Piper, working on behalf of Duo, explained.

Some AWS users make these snapshots public so they can easily access them. As a result, Piper found 116,386 publicly available
EBS snapshots exposed to the internet, from 3,213 different accounts. [Full article](https://duo.com/decipher/exposed-aws-resources-leaked-sensitive-data)
